# Code with Nas - HeadstartWp App

"Code with Nas" is a focused Proof of Concept (POC) developed as part of a job application, inspired by insights from 30 Seconds of Code. It offers tailored code snippets and informative articles to enhance the development experience.

## Project Overview

This project presents a Headless CMS WordPress power by Next.js application that elegantly integrates the following technologies:

- [HeadstartWp Framework](https://headstartwp.10up.com/): Harnessing the power of WordPress as a headless content management system.
- [Next.js Page Router](https://nextjs.org/): Facilitating seamless and dynamic page navigation.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/): Serving as the trusted source for content and content management.
